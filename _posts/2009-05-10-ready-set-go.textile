Hello there! This is the first post of this blog.

I've been blogging since 2007 in portuguese and now I think it's time to try to reach a wider public - the developers from all around the world. This will help to learn more from comments and criticism and also help to improve my communication ability in english.

Sometimes I'll cross-post translated articles on my blogs, but there will be "exclusive" content on both of them too.

I like many facets of software development - from agile methodologies and the human aspects of a knowledge based activity to frameworks and dynamic languages. My current main interest is TDD/BDD, so you'll be reading many articles concerning this practice if you chose to follow me along. Thank you and welcome!

Ready. Set. GO!
