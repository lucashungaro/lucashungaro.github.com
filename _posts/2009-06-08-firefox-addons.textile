Even using just Macs I prefer Firefox to Safari (which I use through Fluid for some web apps) 'cause of it's great extensibility and variety of add-ons. Below is a list of the ones I use and recommend for web development and general internet surfing:

* "Firebug":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843 you know it, it's obligatory (Safari 4's developer tools are great too);
* "YSlow":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5369 brings to you Yahoo's performance guidelines for web pages;
* "Page Speed":http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/ like YSlow, but from Google (a Firebug extension);
* "Firecookie":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6683 an extension to Firebug that allows you to view and manage cookies contents;
* "Web Developer Toolbar":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60 a collection of nice tools for web development (like markup validation, browser window resizing, page elements manipulation and a lot of other tools);
* "Ubiquity":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9527 many describe it as "Spotlight":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software) for Firefox - I agree;
* "Wolfram Alpha Google":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12006 integrates Google and Wolfram Alpha knowledge engine (really nice);
* "Speed Dial":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4810 enables direct access to your favorite websites through Firefox's start page;
* "Download Statusbar":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26 less intrusive download management (think Google Chrome);
* "TwitterFox":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5081 simple integrated Twitter client;
* "Locationbar²":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4014 enhance your browser's location bar (highlights domain name to prevent spoofing, linkifies URL segments and other options).
