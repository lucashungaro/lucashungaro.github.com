This is more to remember myself of all Firefox addons I use when I'm configuring a new machine from the ground up. Here's the list with the link to the add-on and a short description:

* Firebug
* YSlow
* Firecookie
* Web Developer Toolbar
* Ubiquity
* Speed Dial
* Download Statusbar
* TwitterFox
* Locationbar
